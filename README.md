XDL
===

An sdl framework that allows rapid game developement in C++.

In 4th year of college I tried to write an abstraction layer over SDL, to try and give people a strong starting point to make games in c++. I incorperated the project into any and all assignments where I could, and tried to generalize everything for use within the framework.
